     Cron expressions are comprised of 6 required fields and one optional field
     separated by white space. The fields respectively are described as follows:

     </tr>
     </table>
     <p>
     The '*' character is used to specify all values. For example, &quot;*&quot; 
     in the minute field means &quot;every minute&quot;.
     </p>
     <p>
     The '?' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It
     is used to specify 'no specific value'. This is useful when you need to
     specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other.
     </p>
     <p>
     The '-' character is used to specify ranges For example &quot;10-12&quot; in
     the hour field means &quot;the hours 10, 11 and 12&quot;.
     </p>
     <p>
     The ',' character is used to specify additional values. For example
     &quot;MON,WED,FRI&quot; in the day-of-week field means &quot;the days Monday,
     Wednesday, and Friday&quot;.
     </p>
     <p>
     The '/' character is used to specify increments. For example &quot;0/15&quot;
     in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45&quot;. And 
     &quot;5/15&quot; in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 5, 20, 35, and
     50&quot;.  Specifying '*' before the  '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is
     the value to start with. Essentially, for each field in the expression, there
     is a set of numbers that can be turned on or off. For seconds and minutes, 
     the numbers range from 0 to 59. For hours 0 to 23, for days of the month 0 to
     31, and for months 1 to 12. The &quot;/&quot; character simply helps you turn
     on every &quot;nth&quot; value in the given set. Thus &quot;7/6&quot; in the
     month field only turns on month &quot;7&quot;, it does NOT mean every 6th 
     month, please note that subtlety.  
     </p>
     <p>
     The 'L' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
     This character is short-hand for &quot;last&quot;, but it has different 
     meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value &quot;L&quot; in 
     the day-of-month field means &quot;the last day of the month&quot; - day 31 
     for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the 
     day-of-week field by itself, it simply means &quot;7&quot; or 
     &quot;SAT&quot;. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it
     means &quot;the last xxx day of the month&quot; - for example &quot;6L&quot;
     means &quot;the last friday of the month&quot;. When using the 'L' option, it
     is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get 
     confusing results.
     </p>
     <p>
     The 'W' character is allowed for the day-of-month field.  This character 
     is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.  As an 
     example, if you were to specify &quot;15W&quot; as the value for the 
     day-of-month field, the meaning is: &quot;the nearest weekday to the 15th of
     the month&quot;. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on 
     Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the
     16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. 
     However if you specify &quot;1W&quot; as the value for day-of-month, and the
     1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 
     'jump' over the boundary of a month's days.  The 'W' character can only be 
     specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
     </p>
     <p>
     The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined for the day-of-month 
     expression to yield 'LW', which translates to &quot;last weekday of the 
     month&quot;.
     </p>
     <p>
     The '#' character is allowed for the day-of-week field. This character is
     used to specify &quot;the nth&quot; XXX day of the month. For example, the 
     value of &quot;6#3&quot; in the day-of-week field means the third Friday of 
     the month (day 6 = Friday and &quot;#3&quot; = the 3rd one in the month). 
     Other examples: &quot;2#1&quot; = the first Monday of the month and 
     &quot;4#5&quot; = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify
     &quot;#5&quot; and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then
     no firing will occur that month. If the '#' character is used, there can
     only be one expression in the day-of-week field (&quot;3#1,6#3&quot; is 
     not valid, since there are two expressions).
     </p>
     <p>
     <!--The 'C' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
     This character is short-hand for "calendar". This means values are
     calculated against the associated calendar, if any. If no calendar is
     associated, then it is equivalent to having an all-inclusive calendar. A
     value of "5C" in the day-of-month field means "the first day included by the
     calendar on or after the 5th". A value of "1C" in the day-of-week field
     means "the first day included by the calendar on or after sunday". -->
     </p>
     <p>
     The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not
     case sensitive.
     </p>
     <p>
     <b>NOTES:</b>
     <ul>
     <li>Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is
     not complete (you'll need to use the '?' character in one of these fields).
     </li>
     <li>Overflowing ranges is supported - that is, having a larger number on 
     the left hand side than the right. You might do 22-2 to catch 10 o'clock 
     at night until 2 o'clock in the morning, or you might have NOV-FEB. It is 
     very important to note that overuse of overflowing ranges creates ranges 
     that don't make sense and no effort has been made to determine which 
     interpretation CronExpression chooses. An example would be 
     "0 0 14-6 ? * FRI-MON". </li>
     </ul>
